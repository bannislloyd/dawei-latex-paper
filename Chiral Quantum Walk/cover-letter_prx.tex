We are pleased to submit for your consideration our dual
theoretical/experimental paper,
{\it Realizing Chiral Quantum Walks}.
In this article, we report about our finding on how breaking
time-reversal symmetry (so that a quantum particle traveling backwards
in time can be discerned from one traveling forwards) provides a new
handle to control quantum systems.


Due to the application-centric focus of our study (contrasting this
with a long interest regarding time-asymmetry in fundamental physics),
we feel that our findings are of significant interest to the broader
physics audience.  Our work puts forth a modern account of
time-asymmetry theory using the techniques from quantum information
and transport science. The theory we developed in our work allowed us
to pinpoint a meaningful fundamental (and first) demonstration,
illustrating how the effect can now be used in practice.

Our manuscript also includes a precise classification of the effect's
strong dependence on the global topology of the underlying network of
the quantum system.  Intriguingly, we found that the effect is present
in many but not all of the typical quantum
circuits/algorithms/protocols used across the field of quantum
information science.

We suggest the following list of experts to serve as impartial
referees as each of them is a leading scientist the fields that we
expect to have strong impact in:
