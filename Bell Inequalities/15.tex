\begin{abstract}
We simulate the violation of MABK inequality for a three-qubit GHZ
state in a NMR system. Furthermore, for generalized GHZ states, the
tests of different Bell's inequalities, MABK inequality and Chen's
inequality are also carried out. The experimental results display
that MABK inequality is inefficienct in a region of generalized GHZ
states. However, Chen's inequality is efficienct for any generalized
GHZ entangled states.

\subsection*{I. Introduction}
\begin{frame}
 In 1964, Bell showed that in all local realistic
theories, correlations between the outcomes of measurements in
different parts of a physical system satisfy a certain class of
inequalities \cite{Bell}. However, it is easily found that entangled
states violate these inequalities in quantum mechanics. From these
inequalities, the crucial conflict between classical theory and
quantum mechanics is shown. Hence, Bell's work was described as "the
most profound discovery of science" \cite{Stapp} or "one of the
greatest discoveries of modern science" \cite{Zukowski}. Later, many
important generalizations, including the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) \cite{CHSH} and Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK)
inequalities \cite{MABK} have been developed. More recently, Werner
and Wolf and \.{Z}ukowski and Brukner (WWZB)derived a set of
multipartite Bell inequalities, by using two dichotomic observables
per site \cite{WWZB}. Recently, there has been increasing interest
in the subject of Bell's inequalities, not only to test foundation
problems of quantum mechanics, but also because of their relation to
quantum communication \cite{ Brukner, Brassard, Scarani} and quantum
cryptography \cite{Chen,Acin and Gisin}. For example, the security
of some quantum communication protocols are based on the
loophole-free violation of Bell inequalities \cite{Acin and Gisin,
Barrett, Acin and Brunner}. Furthermore, Bell’s inequalities can be
a useful tool to detect entanglement, which is a powerful
computational resource in quantum computation \cite{Nielsen}.

Various experiments to test Bell inequality have been performed, in
a wide range of systems including photons \cite{Freedman, Aspect,
Weihs}, atoms systems \cite{Moehring, Matsukevich1, Matsukevich2},
atomic ensembles \cite{Matsukevich3, Chou}, and trapped ions
\cite{Rowe}. Recently, an experiment to simulate the violation of
CHSH inequality has been carried out in NMR system \cite{Souza}.

In this paper, we simulate the violation of Bell-type inequalities
for three-qubit GHZ state in NMR system. Furthermore, we also
simulate the violation of Bell-type inequalities for generalized GHZ
states in NMR system. Previous experiments mainly focused on the
maximal entangled states, such as Bell state, standard GHZ state,
etc, rarely on nonmaximal entangled states, such as generalized GHZ
states. The reason is, such as in photon experiments, preparing a
nonmaximal entangled state is as difficult as standard GHZ state.
Researchers generally consider it is not worth the candle in photon
system \cite{Lu}. On the other hand, there are many phenomena
disclosed by nonmaximal entangled states, for instance, the
nonmaximal entangled states make lots of Bell-type inequalities
arrive the maximal violation \cite{Acin and Durt, Methot and
Scarani}. There are still many open problems about nonmaximal
entangled states. Especially, as the number of particle increasing,
it may exhibit unexpected properties. Therefore, it is interesting
and meaningful to study the nonmaximal entangled states.

For generalized GHZ states, Scarani and Gisin \cite{Scarani and
Gisin} firstly found that there exist a region of three-qubit
generalized GHZ states \eqref{generalized GHZ state} satisfy the
MABK inequality. It is shown that for $\theta\leq \pi/12$ or
$\theta\geq5\pi/12$ the states \eqref{generalized GHZ state} do not
violate the three-qubit MABK inequality. Hence, Scarani and Gisin
deduced that MABK inequalities and more generally the family of
Bell's inequalities with two observables per qubit, may not be the
'natural' generalizations of the CHSH inequality to more than two
qubits \cite{Scarani and Gisin}. Whereafter, a set of multipartite
Bell inequalities has been elegantly derived, which is the WWZB
inequality \cite{WWZB}. Actually, The WWZB inequalities include MABK
inequalities as special cases. Furthermore, \.{Z}ukowski
\emph{et.al} proved and showed that \cite{Zukowski and Brukner and
Laskowski and Wiesniak} (i)for $N=even$, although the generalized
GHZ state does not violate MABK inequalities, it violates the WWZB
inequality, and (ii) for $N=odd$ and
$sin(2\theta)\leq1/\sqrt{2^{N-1}}$, the correlations between
measurements on qubits in the generalized GHZ state satisfy all Bell
inequalities for correlation functions, which involve two dichotomic
observables per local measurement station. As to obtain such a
Bell-type inequality involving only two measurement settings per
observer, which is violated by the generalized GHZ state in the
whole region of $\theta$ for any number of qubits, several notable
work were shown. Chen and Wu \emph{et al.} developed several Bell
inequalities in terms of both probabilities and correlation
functions for three qubits, which can be seen numerically to be
violated by any pure entangled state \cite{J. L. Chen, C. F. Wu}.
Recently, a more significant progress derived by K. Chen \emph{et
al.} \cite{k.Chen}. They presented a family of Bell inequalities
involving only two measurement settings of each observer for $N>2$
qubits, which is not only violated by the $N$-qubit generalized GHZ
state in the whole region,but also the amount of maximal violation
grows exponentially as $2^{(N-2)/2}$.

From the above description in theory, more efficient Bell-type
inequalities for generalized GHZ states are derived. However, no
experiments aim to display so far. Therefore, we simulate tests for
different Bell's inequalities, MABK inequality \cite{MABK} and
Chen's inequality \cite{k.Chen}in NMR system. The experimental
results obviously display that MABK inequality is inefficient in a
region of generalized GHZ states. However, Chen's inequality is
efficient for any generalized GHZ entangled states. The facts proved
that all of our experimental results are coincident with the
prediction of quantum mechanics.

The content of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
introduced the experiment about violation of MABK inequality for
standard three-qubit GHZ state in NMR system. Furthermore, In Sec.
III, we simulate the violation of MABK inequality for generalized
 GHZ states. In Sec. IV, the experimental results of simulating the violation of Chen's inequality for generalized
 GHZ states were derived. Finally, we summarize
and discuss our results.
\end{frame}
\subsection*{II.Simulation violation of MABK inequality for GHZ state}
\begin{frame}
Let us consider such a scenario: there are three observers Alice
(\emph{A}), Bob (\emph{B}), and Charlie (\emph{C}), each having one
qubit. The formulation of the MABK inequality based on the
assumption that every observer is allowed to choose between two
dichotomic observables. Denote the outcome of observer $X$'s
measurement by $X_{i}, X=A,B,C$, with $i=1,2$. Under the assumption
of local realism, each outcome can either take value $+1$ or $-1$.
In a specific run of the experiment, the correlations between the
measurement outcomes of all three observers can be represented by
the product $A_{i}B_{j}C_{k}$, where $i , j , k=1, 2$. In a local
realistic theory, the correlation function of the measurements
performed by all three observers is the average of $A_{i}B_{j}C_{k}$
over many runs of the experiment,  The MABK inequality reads
\cite{MABK}
%\begin{widetext}%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{MABK}
&|&E(A_{1},B_{2},C_{2})+E(A_{2},B_{1},C_{2})+\nonumber\\
&&E(A_{2},B_{2},C_{1})-E(A_{1},B_{1},C_{1}){}|\leq2.
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}%
We denote the left-hand side of the MABK inequality by
$\mathcal{B}_{MABK}$ where $-2\leq\mathcal{B}_{MABK}\leq2$. In any
local hidden variable (LHV) theory, the absolute value of a
particular combination of correlations is bounded by 2. However, if
one turns to quantum mechanics, this inequality can be violated. For
MABK inequality, the maximal violation allowed by quantum mechanics
is $4$ \cite{Scarani and Gisin}, which for standard GHZ state,
\begin{equation}\label{standard GHZ state}
\left\vert \Phi \right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\left\vert 000
\right\rangle+\left\vert 111 \right\rangle).
\end{equation}

To prepare standard GHZ state from $\left\vert 000 \right\rangle$,
we used the network as shown in Fig.1, by selecting the rotation
angle $2\theta=\pi/2$. After that, we will measure the spin
projection $\bm{\sigma\cdot n}$, where
$\bm{\sigma}=(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z)$ is the vector form of
Pauli matrices and the two measurement directions for every qubit we
chose here are $\bm{n_1}=(1,0,0)$ and
$\bm{n_2}=(\cos\alpha,\sin\alpha,0)$.

For this special spin projection measurement, the theoretical result
of $\mathcal{B}_{MABK}$ is (for convenience we just ignore the
absolute value sign)
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}_{MABK}=3( \cos^{2}\alpha-\sin^{2} \alpha)-1,
\end{equation}
displaying that for $\alpha=0.3041\pi\sim0.6959\pi$ the result
violates MABK inequality and reach the maximal violation value $4$
when $\alpha=\pi/2$, as shown in Fig.4.
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{net.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{A quantum network for creating a generalize
GHZ state. The initial state is $\left\vert 000 \right\rangle$.
After rotating qubit 1 by the angle $2\theta$ about Y axis, we get
$\cos\theta\left\vert 000 \right\rangle+\sin\theta\left\vert 100
\right\rangle$.Then through two control gates CNOT$_{12}$ and
CNOT$_{13}$, a generalize GHZ state $\cos\theta\left\vert 000
\right\rangle+\sin\theta\left\vert 111 \right\rangle$ will be
created.}}
\end{figure}

For NMR experimental implementation, there are still two problems to
be solved. Firstly, the thermal equilibrium state of a NMR system at
room temperature is highly mixed. We can use pseudo-pure state(PPS)
\cite{Gershenfeld} technique to overcome this, that the initial
state is transformed to
\begin{equation}
\rho_{pps}=\frac{(1-\varepsilon)}{2^n}I_{2^n}+\varepsilon\left\vert
\varphi\right\rangle\left\langle\varphi\right\vert,
\end{equation}
which is a mixture of the totally mixed state $I_{2^n}$ unchanged
when applying with unitary transformations and a pure state
$\left\vert \varphi\right\rangle$ which we set to be $\left\vert 0
\right\rangle$ in our experiment with the polarization
$\varepsilon=10^{-5}\sim10^{-6}$. So ignoring $I_{2^n}$ which does
not affect NMR experiments and using the entanglement(strictly,
pseudo-entanglement) of the pure part, we can simulate violation of
the Bell-type inequalities we mentioned in this letter. Another
problem is only the spin projection values under computational basis
can be directly measured. The solution is we can rotate the state or
density matrix instead of changing the projective direction,
\begin{eqnarray}
M=Tr(\rho\cdot M_{1})=Tr(\rho\cdot U^{+}M_2U) \nonumber\\
=Tr(U\rho U^{+}\cdot M_2),
\end{eqnarray}
where $M_1$ and $M_2$ is the desired measurement and experimental
measurement, respectively. $U$ is one unitary operation satisfying
$M_1=U^{+}M_2U$. In NMR experiments we can apply $U$ to the density
matrix and then perform measurement of $M_2$, which is equivalent to
measuring $M_1$.

All experiments were performed at room temperature on a Bruker
Avance 400MHz NMR spectrometer. We used the spins of three
${}^{13}\!C$ nucle in alanine dissolved in $D_2 O$. The system
Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{equation}
H_{sys}=\sum_{i=1}^3 \omega_i I_z^i+2\pi\sum_{i<j}^3 J_{ij} I_z^i
I_z^j,
\end{equation}
with the Larmor angular frequencies $\omega_i$ in the rotating frame
and $J$-coupling constants $J_{ij}$, whose values are listed in
Fig.2.
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{structure.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{Molecular structure and Hamiltonian
parameters for alanine. The diagonal elements are the chemical
shifts of the three carbon nuclei and the off-diagonal elements are
the J-coupling strengths. }}
\end{figure}

The whole experiment was divided into three steps. Firstly, to
prepare $\rho_{pps}$ from the thermal equilibrium state, using the
spatial average technique \cite{Cory}. Secondly, to prepare a
standard GHZ state, we use a Hardmard gate and two CNOT gates, that
is to say, set $\theta=\pi/2$ in Fig.1. Finally, to rotate the
required qubits and execute the projective measurements.

In order to improve the accuracy of radio frequency (RF) pulses, we
use strongly modulating pulse (SMP) techniques \cite{Fortunato}. We
also maximize the effective gate fidelity by averaging over a
weighted distribution of RF field strengths to overcome the
inhomogeneity of the RF fields over the sample. The gate fidelity we
calculated for every pulse is higher than 0.995 considering the RF
field inhomogeneity. The range of the pulse lengths are about from
$200\sim 700\mu s$.
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{tomo.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{Theoretical (a) and experimental (b) density
matrices of the standard GHZ state $(\left\vert 000
\right\rangle+\left\vert 111 \right\rangle)/{\sqrt{2}}$. The bars'
height at the four vertices of the density matrix is 0.5
theoretically, respectively. The fidelity is 0.98.}}
\end{figure}

Fig.3 (b) shows a full state tomography of the standard GHZ state in
experiment. The overall fidelity is
\begin{equation}
F=\frac{Tr(\rho_{th}\rho_{exp})}{\sqrt{(Tr(\rho^2_{th})Tr(\rho^2_{exp}))}}=0.98,
\end{equation}
We take several sets of observers to do the corresponding
measurement on standard GHZ state. The result is shown in the Fig.4,
which the blue squares stand for the experiment results, and the red
thick line stands for the theoretical result. Clearly, the
experiment results in excellent agreement with the theoretical
expectation of quantum mechanics.
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{MABK1.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{ $\mathcal{B}_{MABK}$ as a function of
$\alpha$. The red thick line stands for the theoretical expectation,
and the blue square stands for the experimental data.}}
\end{figure}

Of course, if we had considered the huge mixed state $I_{2^n}$ into
the experiment, we would get the result in agreement with the
classical theory. Therefore, this is why we emphasize that the
experiments are simulation not proof.

\end{frame}
\subsection*{III. Simulation violation of MABK inequality for generalize GHZ states}
\begin{frame}
So far, almost all previous Bell experiments were performed on
maximal entangled states, such as Bell state and standard GHZ state.
Recently, sorts of unexpected properties about nonmaximal entangled
states have been shown\cite{Acin and Durt, Methot and Scarani}.
Therefore, we simulate the violation of MABK inequalities for
generalized GHZ states in NMR system further. The generalized GHZ
states can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{generalized GHZ state}
\left\vert \Psi \right\rangle=\cos\theta\left\vert 000
\right\rangle+\sin \theta\left\vert 111 \right\rangle.
\end{equation}
which $\theta\in[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.

In this experiment, we choose the directions of the two measurements
for every particles are $\bm{n_1}=(1,0,0)$ and $\bm{n_2}=(0,1,0)$.
For these special spin projection measurements, the theoretical
result of $\mathcal{B}_{MABK}$ for generalized GHZ states satisfies
such a function,
\begin{equation}\label {1}
|\mathcal{B}_{MABK}|=|-4\sin(2\theta)|.
\end{equation}
From \eqref{1}, one can see that the maximal violation is obtained
when $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ just the standard GHZ state. Obviously,
the MABK inequality only in the region of $\theta\in[\frac{\pi}{12},
\frac{5\pi}{12}]$ is efficient, in other words, only in such region
the inequality can be violated. Therefore, MABK inequality is not
efficient in the whole region of generalized GHZ states.

We measured a set of generalized GHZ states with particular angle
$\theta$.
 The result is shown in Fig.5. The experimental result is
coincident with the prediction of quantum theory.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{MABK2.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{The values of $\mathcal{B}_{MABK}$ as a
function of $\theta$. The red thick line stands for the theoretical
expectation, and the blue squares stand for the experiment data.}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}
\subsection*{IV. Simulation violation of Chen's inequality for generalize GHZ states}
\begin{frame}
For a three-qubit system, Chen's inequality can be written as
\begin{widetext}%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{B}_{Chen}=\frac{1}{2}(E(A_{1},B_{1},C_{1})+E(A_{1},B_{2},C_{1})+E(A_{2},B_{1},C_{1})-
E(A_{2},B_{2},C_{1})+E(A_{1},B_{1},C_{2})+\nonumber\\
E(A_{1},B_{2},C_{2})+
E(A_{2},B_{1},C_{2})-E(A_{2},B_{2},C_{2}))+E(C_{1})-E(C_{2}),
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}%
 $|\mathcal{B}_{Chen}|\leq2$ in the LHV model.

In experiment, based on [29], we take the directions of two
measurement about $A$ and $B$ as $\bm{n_1}=(1,0,0)$ and
$\bm{n_2}=(0,1,0)$. For $C$, the directions of two measurement are
$\bm{n_1}=(\sin\alpha\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}),\sin\alpha\sin(-\frac{\pi}{4}),\cos\alpha)$
and
$\bm{n_2}=(\sin(\pi-\alpha)\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}),\sin(\pi-\alpha)\sin(-\frac{\pi}{4}),\cos(\pi-\alpha))$,
where
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha=\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{2}\tan(2\theta)),\quad\quad\quad\quad
   0\leq\theta\leq\frac{\pi}{4}\nonumber
\\\alpha=\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{2}\tan(2\theta))+\pi,\quad\quad
   \frac{\pi}{4}\leq\theta\leq\frac{\pi}{2}
\end{eqnarray}
Then, we obtain $\mathcal{B}_{Chen}$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}_{Chen}=2(2\sin^{2}(2\theta)+\cos^{2}(2\theta))^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Chen.eps}
\caption{\footnotesize{The values of $\mathcal{B}_{Chen}$ as a
function of $\theta$. The red thick line stands for the theoretical
result, and the blue square stands for the experiment result.}}
\end{figure}
The results are always larger than $2$ no matter whatever $\theta$
is. It illustrates that, the whole region of generalized GHZ states
can violate the inequality by a set of suitable observation angles.

Obviously, Chen's inequality is more efficient than MABK inequality
for generalized GHZ states. The experimental result is shown in
Fig.6, which perfectly simulates the violation of Chen's inequality
for generalize GHZ states. It is shows that our experimental result
is in good agreement with quantum mechanical theory.

\end{frame}
\subsection*{V. Conclusions}
\begin{frame}
In summary, we have simulated the experimental violation of MABK
inequalities for a three-qubit GHZ state in a NMR system.
Furthermore, we focus on the nonmaximal entangled states, the
violation of MABK inequality for generalized states in NMR system
are shown. The experimental results are well in agreement with the
expectation of quantum mechanics. As to exhibit test of different
Bell-type inequality for generalized GHZ states, we also simulated
Chen's inequality. Comparing these two results, it shows that MABK
inequality is not efficient in the whole region of generalized GHZ
states. While, Chen's inequality is efficient for any generalized
GHZ entangled state. The facts proved that all of our experimental
results are coincident with the prediction of quantum mechanics.

It is necessary to emphasize that, in strict, because NMR qubits are
many nuclear spins of atoms bounded together in a single molecule,
separated by a few angstroms, the an NMR experiment is inherently
local. Our results are also in good agreement with the local hidden
variable theory. It may appear puzzled that quantum and classical
theory are both consistent with our experiments. However, it can be
understood, although the entire system is local, NMR is only
sensible for the deviation part of the mixed state, which behaves
like a "pure entangled state". Hence, our experiments in NMR system
do not really prove the violation of Bell-type inequalities. This is
why we always explain that our experiments are simulation not proof.
Whereas, the meaning is that, when we experimentally simulate the
violation of different Bell-type inequalities for arbitrary
generalized three-qubit GHZ states in NMR system, the results
excellently display the quantum predictions. It tells us, despite of
existed many disputes, NMR systems may contribute more on some
fundamentals of quantum mechanics. After all, it is less exploited
experimentally outside the scope of optics.  Besides, if our
experiments were carried out in a highly polarized spin ensemble
\cite{Anwar}, true entangled states can be achieved and
contradiction between hidden variables models and quantum theory
could be detected. As a refined tool and technique for
experimentally realizing quantum computation in the last decade, NMR
is still contributing to many fundamental problems of quantum
mechanics now. In the future, we will still pay attention to this
area.
